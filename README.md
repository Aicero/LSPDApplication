# LSPDApplication

### Purpose
When I was playing GTA:SAMP Role Play server I was in charge of fraction, where players could imitate working in the Police Departament. Application was made to help me with my routine activities like counting 'duty' time of each player, preparing new forum topics and more. A few weeks lates the server was closed. Application can not be updated any more because it uses specific syntax of .html files that provided an input data to work with.
